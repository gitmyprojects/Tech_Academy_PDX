* Add some styling to the member login dropdown in the navbar
    -padding and center
* connect the login to the database
    -it is connected, however, how do i know when im logged in or out?
* An error message was triggered when creating a new user but I only see it in the terminal, not the page.
* add project to gitgub
    add adam/ryhan as collaborators.
* add a button to the 'join the debate' section to take them to the newuser page
* add discussion board to each debate page
* create auto generated page when a new topic is created
    -use the webpagegenerator project in the Python folder
* style the new user page
* the middle card doesnt adjust correctly to the screen.
* The auto-generated page for each topic should include:
    - the items being debated
    - a like button for each item
        how do i limit the user to one vote?
    - a chart that shows votes, ending date, and winner.
* connect user profiles to the leaderboard.
    - once a winner is declared, the user will need to get their points added but this needs to be automated for
    different point levels.
        - should there be points just for voting?
    - I imagine JS and or jquery would be used to automatically update this board periodically
* Add a "Hello, 'user'" to the upper right corner to show whether or not you are logged in.
    ? How does it know which user is logged in?
*^ Add new user confirmation page
    ? can i redirect after a set amount of time?
*^ Correct the HttpResponseRedirect for the createuser page. It needs to confirm the submission.
* how do i embed an httpresponse to welcome the user?
    -this is covered somewhere in the course, i think the django hotel/ university project
