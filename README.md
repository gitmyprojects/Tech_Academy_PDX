# Tech_Academy_PDX
This repository is created to store projects that I am working on. The purpose is to collaborate with other developers as I continue to learn. Once I reach a point that I need help, this repository will be used to share my code and get advice.

This is my first introduction to Python and lead to enrollment in the Tech Academy.

The program is designed to take in user input of a first, middle, and last name as well as DOB. Then, check a database for a match and return the result. If there is no match, the entry will be added to the database. If there is a match, the user will see message stating that this information matches an entry already in the database.

The program is coded to check for user input errors such as numbers in the place of text, unreasonable numbers entered for date of birth such as 35 for the day of the month.

Loops are initiated when there are user input errors that instruct the user to re-enter the required information in the correct format.
